### Overview
This project is a JavaFX application that allows users to select shapes and colors and draw them on a canvas.
The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can choose different shapes, select their preferred colors, and then draw the chosen shapes in the selected color on a canvas.

### Project Structure
* Main.java: The entry point of the application. It initializes the JavaFX application and loads the main FXML layout for the user interface.
* Controller.java: Manages user interactions within the JavaFX GUI. It handles the selection of shapes and colors and implements the logic for drawing the selected shapes in the chosen colors on the canvas.
* Color.class: Represents color objects within the application, managing attributes like RGB values and providing methods for color manipulation.
* Main.fxml: The FXML file that defines the layout and structure of the JavaFX user interface. It describes the arrangement of elements such as buttons, color pickers, and the canvas where shapes are drawn.
* run.bat: A batch script to compile and run the JavaFX project easily.
